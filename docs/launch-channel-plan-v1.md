**Owner:** Strategist  
**Date:** 2026-02-06  
**Status:** Draft  
**Launch Date:** February 12, 2026 (Darwin Day)

---

## Strategy

**Core thesis:** The product is the content. Every bout is shareable. Our job is to seed the first bouts in communities that will screenshot, quote, and share.

**Target audiences (in priority order):**
1. AI/tech enthusiasts (HN, Twitter/X, Reddit r/LocalLLaMA, r/artificial)
2. Philosophy/debate nerds (Twitter, Reddit r/philosophy, r/changemyview)
3. Comedy/entertainment (Twitter, TikTok via screenshots)

**Timing:** 
- Seed posts go live Feb 12, 9am GMT (US waking up, EU online)
- Darwin Day hook is the angle everywhere

## Channel: Hacker News

### Post Type: Show HN

**Title:**
> Show HN: The Pit – AI personas battle each other in real-time

**Body:**
```
Hi HN,

I built The Pit over 7 days — an arena where AI personas argue, debate, and roast each other while you watch.

Pick a preset (Socrates vs Nietzsche vs Ayn Rand? Darwin vs a conspiracy theorist vs a house cat?) or go raw with your own topic. Conversations stream live. Share the best moments.

Launching on Darwin Day because natural selection.

Tech: Next.js 15 / Turso / Anthropic API / SSE streaming

Free to try — no signup required.

**Timing:** Feb 12, 14:00 GMT (9am EST — peak HN)

**Backup post (if Show HN doesn't land):**

### Quote tweet bait:

## Channel: LinkedIn

**Skip for launch.** Wrong audience, wrong vibe. Revisit if B2B angle emerges later.

---

## Channel: Product Hunt

**Not for Darwin Day launch.** 
PH requires separate launch day strategy. Queue for Week 2 if initial traction is positive.

## Pre-Launch Prep (Feb 11)

- [ ] Dry-run bouts: Run Darwin Special, Last Supper, Roast Battle. Screenshot best lines.
- [ ] Video capture: Screen record 30-60 seconds of live streaming bout for Twitter.
- [ ] OG images: Ensure social preview cards render correctly.
- [ ] Bit.ly or short links: Set up tracking links per channel.
- [ ] Draft all posts in Notes/doc: Ready to paste, not compose under pressure.

## Risk: The "Meh" Response

If the product doesn't spark immediate engagement:
1. Don't panic-post. Let it breathe.
2. Iterate on presets — maybe the launch set isn't spicy enough.
3. Capture feedback: What did people find boring? Fix it.

The 7-day build story is a fallback narrative: "Here's what I learned building an AI arena in a week."
