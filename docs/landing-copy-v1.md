# Landing Page Copy — v1

**Owner:** Strategist  
**Date:** 2026-02-06  
**Status:** Draft — awaiting review

---

## Hero Section

### Headline Options

**A) Visceral**
> **Pick your fighters. Watch them clash.**

**B) Provocative**
> **What happens when AI stops being polite?**

**C) Direct**
> **AI vs AI. No rules. You watch.**

**Recommendation:** Option A — action-oriented, immediately clear, scales to mobile.

### Subhead
> Drop legendary minds into an arena. Watch them argue, roast, and philosophize until only one idea survives.

### Primary CTA
> **Start a Bout** (big, centered, high contrast)

### Secondary CTA
> **Watch a Fight** → links to featured replay

## Above the Fold — The 5-Second Pitch

User lands. In 5 seconds they must understand:
1. What this is (AI battle arena)
2. What they do (pick fighters, watch)
3. Why it's interesting (entertainment, shareability, novelty)

**Visual:** Live conversation streaming — not a screenshot, the actual product running. Show, don't tell.

---

## Social Proof / Trust Strip

Pre-launch, we have none. Options:

**A) Skip it entirely** — honest, clean

**B) Placeholder with intent:**
> "From the builders of [wasp/other projects]" — if Kai wants to link portfolio

**C) Intrigue hook:**
> "Built in 7 days. Launched on Darwin Day."

**Recommendation:** Option C — leans into the speed/craft angle, creates story.

## Preset Browser Section

### Section Header
> **Choose Your Arena**

### Card format:
```
┌────────────────────────────────┐

│                                │
│ 4 fighters · Philosophy        │
│                                │
│ "One line premise/hook"        │

```

### Featured presets for launch:

1. **🦎 The Darwin Special** (launch day hero)

2. **🍷 The Last Supper**
   > "Socrates, Nietzsche, Ayn Rand, and Buddha walk into a bar."

3. **🔥 Roast Battle**
   > "Four AIs. No filters. Maximum carnage."

4. **🛋️ On The Couch**
   > "Therapy session goes sideways."

## How It Works (optional — may cut for simplicity)

If needed, 3-step minimal:

1. **Pick a preset** (or go raw)
2. **Watch the chaos unfold**
3. **Share the best moments**

## Waitlist Section

### Hook
> **Want more?**

### Copy
> First bout is free. Drop your email for early access to unlimited arenas, premium models, and custom fighters.

### CTA
> **[ email input ] [ Join the Waitlist ]**

### Privacy note (small, below)

## Footer

Minimal:
- Built by Kai
- GitHub link (optional)
- Darwin Day 2026

---

## Share Text Templates

For the copy-paste viral mechanic:

### Standard share:
```
🏟 THE PIT — Round 3
🤖 Socrates: "Your entire philosophy collapses the moment you—"
🤖 Hitchens: "My philosophy? You drank hemlock rather than leave town."
⚔️ Watch the full bout: thepit.cloud/b/x7k9
```

### Darwin Special share:
```
🦎 THE DARWIN SPECIAL
🐱 House Cat: "Evolution is a lie. I was always this perfect."
🧬 Darwin: "Fascinating specimen. Clearly peaked 4000 years ago."
🏟 thepit.cloud/b/abc123
```

---

## Resolved

1. **Domain:** `thepit.cloud` (MVP) — thepit.world and thepit.blog reserved for later
2. **Branding:** Logo exists in `assets/`. Color palette TBD.
3. **Darwin Day launch copy:** Countdown timer TBD.

## Next: Launch Channel Plan

Will draft HN, Reddit, Twitter posts separately.
