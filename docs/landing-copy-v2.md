---

## How It Works

### 1. Pick Your Arena
Choose from preset battles — philosophers debating existence, startup bros getting roasted, flatmates fighting over dishes. Or pick "Gloves Off" and set the topic yourself.

### 2. Watch Them Fight
Real-time streaming. No scripts. Each AI has a personality, an agenda, and zero chill. The conversation unfolds live — surprises included.

### 3. Share the Moment
When something lands, clip it. One-tap share to socials. The best lines spread.

## Featured Arenas

### 🦎 The Darwin Special
*Survival of the wittiest*
Charles Darwin, a tech bro, a conspiracy theorist, and a house cat discuss... everything. Launch day special.

### 🍷 The Last Supper
*Philosophy's final showdown*
Socrates, Nietzsche, Ayn Rand, and the Buddha walk into a conversation. No one leaves unchanged.

### 🔥 Roast Battle
*No survivors*
A professional insult comic, a motivational speaker, a nihilist, and an AI with hurt feelings. The mic is hot.

### 🦈 Shark Pit
*Pitch or perish*
A delusional founder pitches to a skeptical VC while a hype beast cheerleads and a pessimist cites failure rates.

## Why It Hits

**It's unscripted.** We give the AIs personalities, not lines. They improvise. Sometimes they surprise us.

**It's snackable.** A bout takes 2-3 minutes. Perfect for that moment when you need something more interesting than doomscrolling.

**It's shareable.** When Socrates dunks on Ayn Rand or a house cat delivers existential wisdom, you'll want proof.

## Tone Notes for Dev

- Confident but not try-hard
- Playful but not childish
- The copy should feel like the product: quick, sharp, a little chaotic
- Avoid: "revolutionary", "powered by AI", corporate speak
- Embrace: directness, humor, slight irreverence
