## What It Is

A social arena where AI personas battle in real-time conversation. Users pick fighters, watch them clash, share the carnage. 

*"Pick your fighters. Watch them clash. Share the carnage."*

## How We Make Money

### Revenue Streams

| Stream | Launch | Month 3+ | Notes |
|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| **Free Tier** | ✓ | ✓ | Loss-leader for acquisition |
| **Pit Pass ($9/mo)** | — | ✓ | Better models, more bouts |
| **Arena ($15/mo)** | — | ✓ | Premium models, unlimited |
| **BYOK ($5/mo)** | — | ✓ | Platform fee, user pays API |

### Unit Economics

| Tier | Price | Our Cost | Margin |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| Free | $0 | ~$1-2/user/mo | -100% |
| Pit Pass | $9/mo | ~$4-5/user/mo | 44-55% |
| Arena | $15/mo | ~$10-12/user/mo | 20-33% |
| BYOK | $5/mo | ~$0/user/mo | 100% |

**Blended margin target:** 40%+ at scale, driven by BYOK adoption.

## How We Grow

### Viral Loop (Primary)

```
User runs bout → Laughs → Shares transcript → Friend clicks → 
Friend runs bout → Repeat
```

**Key metrics:**
- Share rate: % of bouts shared
- K-factor: New users per share
- Time-to-share: How fast users share

### Content Marketing (Secondary)

- "Darwin Awards" for spectacular AI failures
- Leaderboards and AI "seasons"
- User-generated content from bouts

### Paid Acquisition (Future)

Not planned for launch. Free-bout CAC (~$0.01-0.03) is cheaper than any paid channel.

## Market Position

| Competitor | Model | Our Angle |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| Character.AI | Parasocial relationship | We're entertainment, not companionship |
| ChatGPT/Claude | Utility | We're a game, not a tool |
| AI Dungeon | Solo storytelling | We're multiplayer, spectator-driven |

**Unique position:** Multi-agent entertainment with viral mechanics. No one else is doing "AI fight club."

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| API costs spike | High | BYOK shifts cost to users |
| Low virality | High | Iterate on share mechanics |
| Novelty wears off | Medium | Social features, competition |
| Provider blocks us | High | Multi-model support from day 1 |

## Why Now

1. **AI quality crossed the threshold** — Haiku-tier models are now good enough for entertainment
2. **Multi-model APIs are commoditized** — Easy to swap providers if needed
3. **Social AI is nascent** — First-mover advantage still available
4. **Darwin Day launch hook** — Natural virality moment

---

## Ask

**For launch:** $500 API budget, shipping by Feb 12.

**Post-validation:** If viral metrics hit (>5% share rate, >20% D7 retention), consider:
- $5K/mo runway extension
- Part-time community manager
- Domain + brand protection

## The Pitch

> "On the day we celebrate the man who discovered natural selection, we're unleashing it on AI. Only the fittest survive. **The Pit opens February 12th.**"

*This is portfolio signal first, revenue second. If it works, it proves Kai can ship. If it doesn't, we learned fast and cheap.*
