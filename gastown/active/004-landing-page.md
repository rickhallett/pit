## Description

Build the public-facing landing page for The Pit. This is the first thing anyone sees — it needs to immediately communicate what The Pit is, show it in action, and get people either watching a conversation or sharing one.

### Requirements

- **Hero section**: Punchy headline, one-line description, big CTA
- **Live demo / sample output**: Show a real conversation so visitors immediately get it
- **Preset browser**: Cards for available presets — click to run
- **Share landing**: Shared conversation URLs render beautifully
- **BYOK prompt**: Encourage users to bring their own key for unlimited access
- **Email capture**: Waitlist / notify for launch

### Design Principles

- **Show, don't tell**: The product IS the demo. Lead with output, not explanation.
- **Mobile-first**: Entertainment is consumed on phones.
- **Fast**: Page should load instantly.
- **Shareable**: Every conversation gets a unique URL with OG tags.
