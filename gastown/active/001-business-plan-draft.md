## Description

Draft the full business plan for The Pit. This is the foundational document that captures the product vision, market positioning, revenue model, competitive landscape, go-to-market strategy, and financial projections.

This is a collaborative effort — every role contributes their domain expertise:
- **Architect**: Technical feasibility, infrastructure costs, build timeline
- **Strategist**: Market positioning, content strategy, brand voice
- **Analyst**: Cost modelling, revenue projections, competitive analysis
- **Kai**: Vision, final editorial, investor narrative

The business plan should be a living document that evolves as we validate assumptions through building.
